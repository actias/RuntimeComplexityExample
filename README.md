# Runtime Complexity Example

This is an example of how to reduce an O(n*n) complexity function into a O(n) complexity function using LINQ. Check the results on numbers over 1000; I think you'll like them.

I had initially intended to do O(n log n), but then, after reading up on the power of LINQ, came up with this solution which I think is much more elegant.
